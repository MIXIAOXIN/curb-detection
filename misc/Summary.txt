This video illustrates the different steps of the algorithm presented in
the paper "Curb Detection for a Pedestrian Robot in Urban Environments".
The computation time has been intentionally slowed down for visualization
purpose.
In the opening scene, we see a 3D point cloud acquired by a nodding laser range
finder. We select a region of the point cloud and compute a DEM. From the DEM,
a graph-based segmentation provides an initial estimate of the number of planes
in the scene, as well as initial parameters for the mixture of linear
regressions learning. Finally, we apply EM to find the parameters that best
explain the data. In the E-step, we further use a BP stage in order to
incorporate neighboring relations between the covariates. After the estimation
steps, we end up with plane parameters, as well as a classification probability
for each cell of the DEM. The curb locations can be inferred from this latter,
i.e., they are located at the intersections of plane segments.
