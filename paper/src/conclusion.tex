In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to curb detection. We have
devised an unsupervised method that is applicable to various environment
configuration and perspective views. We have demonstrated an application to a
pedestrian robot and shown the robustness of our approach through a thorough
experimental evaluation on real-world and synthetic data.

From a theoretical point of view, we have anchored our method to sound
statistical models from the measurement process to the final inference tasks.
This results into an elegant and efficient algorithm that is solely
parameterized by sensor characteristics. Our approach reconstructs the
environment as a mixture of plane segments and flags curbs at their boundaries.
For the parameter estimation, we have replaced the standard E-step of the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with loopy Belief Propagation (BP) and
justified its utilization. Finally, we have tackled model selection issues with
a graph-based segmentation heuristic.

As a future work, we envision to apply a fully Bayesian treatment to our
method and investigate the use of Hierarchical Mixture of Experts
(HME)~\cite{jordan94hierarchical,bishop03bayesian}. Additionally, we want to
study the feasibility of a recursive estimation framework. Since BP is amenable
to parallelization, it would also be beneficial to use a GPU implementation.
