In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to the curb detection problem.
We have devised an unsupervised method that makes
few assumptions about the environment, restricts the set of hand-tuned
parameters, and builds on sound probabilistic reasoning from the sensing device
to the outcome of the algorithm. In our approach, we have constructed a piecewise
planar model of the environment and determined curbs at plane segment boundaries.
Initially, we have sensed the environment with a nodding laser range-finder and
projected the 3D measurements into an efficient Digital Elevation Map (DEM). Each
cell of the DEM maintains an error model that is propagated throughout the
entire algorithm. Plane segments are further estimated with a mixture of linear
regressions on the DEM. Here, we propose an original formulation of the standard
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for mixture models. Specifically, in the
E-step, the responsibilities are computed with a Conditional Random Field (CRF),
that smooths the assignment of DEM cells to planes of the mixture model. An
initial graph-based segmentation of the DEM provides the first responsibilities
and an estimate of the number of planes. We have shown promising results of the
algorithm on simulated and real-world data.
